Hi I'm self-tought junior front-end designer. This is my mayb not first web page but the first page when I start make difference. This is my own code, I will change and fix many issues in time, I'm still learning important componant about the language, espacially CSS.This is my first responsive attempt, and there are some issues like;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>incompability with cross platforms</li>
      <li> website still not fully responsive</li>
      <li>and mobile design doesnt work yet</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I will be fixed and re-push all my clone & add time stamps because I made this in my computer, I didn't know about Git or repo, yes I learn GitHub before because I started my self-tought journey with Python, GitHub little bit a dungeon for me for crawl<p>

    <p> We will meet again</p>
