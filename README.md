Hi I'm self-taught junior front-end developer. This is my maybe not first web page but the first page when I start make a difference. This is my own code, I will change and fix many issues in time. I'm still learning important componant about the language, espacially CSS. This is my first responsive attempt, and there are some issues like;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>incompability with cross platforms</li>
      <li>website still not fully responsive</li>
      <li>and mobile design doesn't work yet</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I will be fixed and re-push all my clone & add time stamps because I made this in my computer, I didn't know about Git or repo, yes I learned GitHub before because I started my self-taught journey with Python, GitHub little bit a dungeon for me to crawl</p>
   <p> We will meet again</p>
